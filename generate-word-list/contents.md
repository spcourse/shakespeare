# Generate wordlist

In the previous assignment, you used the file 'shakespeare-words.txt'. This file contains a list of words that were said to be typical for Shakespearean writing. The goal here is to create a similar list yourself. To do this, you'll use another set of text fragments known as the 'training set'. This set includes text fragments written by both Shakespeare and other authors. These text fragments are similar to the ones in the previous assignment but not exactly the same.

Your task is to find the words that appear in the text fragments written by Shakespeare but are not present in any of the other text fragments.

> Note: What you're doing here involves using two different sets of data: a 'training set' and a 'test set'. This is a technique frequently used in machine learning. You utilize the 'training set' to create a model, and the 'test set' to evaluate its performance. Often, these two sets are generated by taking a larger dataset and splitting it randomly into these two parts. In this case, you use the 'training set' to generate a list of words typical of Shakespeare, and the 'test set' to assess how well your algorithm works with this specific list of Shakespearean words.

## Specification Phase 2

Create a file named `generate-shakespeare-word-list.py`. In this file, you will develop an algorithm that performs the following steps:

1. Identify all text documents within the `training-set` directory.
2. Construct `set`s of words from all the documents.
3. Utilize the sets generated in step 2 to create two larger `set`s: one containing all words from text fragments by Shakespeare (`set` 1), and another containing words from the remaining text fragments (`set` 2). Which set operation would be suitable for this task?
4. Formulate the set of Shakespearean words by selecting words present in set 1 but absent in set 2. Which set operation would be suitable here?
5. Arrange the results in alphabetical order and write them to the file named `my-shakespeare-words.txt`.

You can verify your outcomes by comparing your file to the provided one using the command line `diff` tool. Enter the following command in the console:

```
diff shakespeare-words.txt my-shakespeare-words.txt
```

You can reuse some of the functions from the previous assignment here. Copy the following functions over to `generate-shakespeare-word-list.py`: `get_text_file_names`, `to_set`, and `tokenize_text`.

Just like in the previous assignment, use a `main` function with the following structure:

```
def main():
    # main code ...

# other functions

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
